Project Notes
=============

  *  this only includes the older Material Design icons. icons not updated yet.
  *  You can add bootstrap glyphicons, but:
    - Must add the reference to the CSS' CDN before all of the other CSS files so it won't override my CSS
    - `<link href="//netdna.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.0.0/css/bootstrap-glyphicons.css" rel="stylesheet">`
    - `<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-globe" aria-hidden="true"></span>`
